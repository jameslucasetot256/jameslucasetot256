# Hi, Iâ€™m James Lucas Etot ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m passionate about using machine learning and computational models to solve real-world energy challenges.  
My work focuses on energy forecasting, time-series modeling, and automation â€” with a growing interest in deep learning and sustainability.

I am currently building projects that explore how machine learning can improve decision-making in energy systems. This work is part of my transition from oil and gas field operations to computational energy systems research.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Interests
- Python, TensorFlow, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Time-series forecasting (ARIMA, SARIMA, LSTM)
- Process automation using Python and VBA
- Energy systems, sustainability, and optimization
- Deep learning for energy data

## ðŸ“‚ Featured Projects
- [Energy Consumption Forecasting (LSTM)](https://github.com/jameslucasetot256/energy-consumption-lstm)
- [Energy Forecasting using ARIMA and SARIMA](https://github.com/jameslucasetot256/energy-consumption-forecasting)

## ðŸš€ Current Focus
- Building machine learning models for energy forecasting
- Preparing for PhD applications in computational energy systems
- Expanding my GitHub portfolio with deep learning and dashboard projects

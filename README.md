# Hi, I’m James Lucas Etot 👋

I’m passionate about applying computational methods, machine learning, and large-scale optimization to solve real-world energy system challenges.

With over two years of experience in the oil and gas industry and a First-Class Degree in Civil Engineering, I am now actively transitioning into **computational energy systems research**.  
My work focuses on building machine learning models, automating processes, and using data to improve energy decision-making.

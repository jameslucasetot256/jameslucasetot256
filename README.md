# Hi, Iâ€™m James Lucas Etot ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m passionate about solving real-world energy challenges using machine learning, data science, and optimization. Iâ€™m currently transitioning into **computational energy systems research** with a growing interest in forecasting, energy modeling, and automation.

I have experience in the oil and gas industry, where I focused on field operations, reporting automation, and troubleshooting. Iâ€™m now applying these skills to energy data, building models, and exploring how advanced analytics can improve energy decision-making.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Interests
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn
- Time-series forecasting (ARIMA, SARIMA)
- Process automation (VBA, Python)
- Energy systems, sustainability, and data-driven optimization
- TensorFlow, LSTM models, dashboard development

## ðŸ“‚ Featured Projects
- [Energy Consumption Forecasting](https://github.com/jameslucasetot256/energy-consumption-forecasting)
- Upcoming: Energy Forecasting Dashboard

## ðŸš€ Current Focus
- Building forecasting models for energy systems
